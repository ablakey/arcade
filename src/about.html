    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      The Arcade is a simple game engine and small library of games written by
      <a href="https://todays.pointless.click">Andrew Blakey</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>WASD/Arrows + SPACEBAR or on-screen buttons. Not every button is used in every game.</p>
    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      I've spent years trying to make games as a relaxing hobby. Unfortunately, most usually get too complicated or
      balloon in scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to have an intentionally primitive game engine that allows me to write a game in about
      a day.

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
